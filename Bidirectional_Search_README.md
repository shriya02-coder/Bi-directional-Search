## Introduction
Bidirectional search is an advanced search algorithm that finds the shortest path from an initial point to a target point by simultaneously running two searchesâ€”one forward from the initial point and the other backward from the target point. This approach is commonly used in graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms where the goal is to find the shortest path.

## Objective
This project has been developed as part of the internal assessment for my AI honours program. The main objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bidirectional Search algorithm and provide a simple code to explore its concepts and applications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of graph theory and algorithms.
- Familiarity with the programming language used (e.g., Python).
- An environment set up for running Python scripts.
